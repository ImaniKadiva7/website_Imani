                <h1>HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS</h1>
                <P>
                    The system has got 3 modes all running concurrently in a non-blocking fashion.
                    The first mode in the list below works initially when the system is powered. 
                    The push button on the left side of the video is used to change to other modes of the system
                    and the push button on the right side in the video is used to display numbers and letters on 
                    the 7 segment display.
                </P>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Consider the following modes of the system.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Traffic lights Contoller module is on and the 7 segment displays letter "t".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Traffic lights controller module is on and the counter module (using shift register, 
                        pushbutton and 7 segment) is on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Traffic lights controller module is on and the Orientation indicator module based on an 
                        accelerometer is on.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    When the system is powered, the traffic lights controller module works straight away and the 
                    7 segment displays t. When the left side push button registers a button normal press, the 
                    second mode starts working. The push button module is sampled every 17ms in the code.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the second mode the traffic lights controller will still be working. In this mode, the
                    counter module and the right push button module will start working as well. When the 
                    right side pushbutton is pressed after 300ms the counter variable is increased and a different 
                    number or letter is displayed on the 7 segment display. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the third mode, the counter module stops working, the traffic lights controller module is
                    still working and the orientation indicator module is now switched on. The orientation 
                    indicator module displays letter "F" on the 7 Segment display indicating that the system is "FLAT",
                    and displays letter "L" on the 7 segment indicating that the system is on "LANDSCAPE".

                    <li>
                        Automotive systems. Modern automobiles are equipped with 
                        numerous embedded systems that need to operate concurrently
                        in a non-blocking fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Industrial Automation. Some manufucturing facilities use embedded 
                        systems to control complex processes. Skills gained in this project,
                        can help to develop code that can manage tasks like machine control
                        and communication in a non-blocking fashion.

                    <li>
                        Robotics. Robots with multiple actuators and sensors need to perform 
                        tasks concurrently such as path planning, motion control with the 
                        environment. Skills gained while doing this project, can be used to 
                        develope code that can run robot tasks in a non-blocking fashion.
